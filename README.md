# udm-local-dns

`udm-local-dns` runs on UDM-SE and generates DNS entries for client devices.


## How it works
`udm-local-dns` polls Network controller API and generates new dnsmasq configuration if network client list changes.


## Compatibility
Only `UniFi OS - Dream Machine SE v2` is supported, i don't have any other devices to test.
